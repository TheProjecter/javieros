# About JavierOS #

- JavierOS is a microkernel operating system, with its focus on modern x86 PC hardware.

- It refers to a variety of codes from the Internet(For example: Linux, minix, L3/L4...).

- I just want to see how well I can work on this operating system, but not to make JavierOS a hot one.

- JavierOS will grow up as well as me every passingday. :-)
